This repository contains the "Cisco" project undertaken as part of my academic coursework. The objective of this project is to explore the capabilities offered by Cisco Packet Tracer to configure a network or Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

It contains .pkt files for different network exercises in Cisco Packet Tracer, along with corresponding screenshots.
